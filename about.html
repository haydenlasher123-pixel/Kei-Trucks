      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="img/Me.jpg" alt="Photo of Hayden Lasher" class="profile-pic">
      <p>
        My name is Hayden Lasher. Right after high school, I joined the Marine Corps where I became an aviation ordnance systems technician (built and fixed the weaponry that went on aircrafts), then became a shooting instructor on the range for both rifle and pistol.
        I was also a wrestling coach for years, as it was a huge passion of mine. After I left the Marine corps, I recieved my 2 year degree in automotive technology from Shoreline Community College, as well as my 2 year diesel technology degree. I worked as an automotive/diesel 
        mechanic for a few years before I wanted to continue my education. More recently, in 2021 I started my 2 year welding degree from Green River Community College.
        Being a blue collar guy most of my life, my body is giving up on me, so that's why I've decided to attempt a 4 year degree for cybersecurity, here at Olympic college.

      <h2>How I Fell in Love with Kei Trucks</h2>
      <p>
       I have an absolute love of the Kei Truck that stems to around 2018. I was freshly out of the Marine Corps, and used my GI bill to attend automotive school to earn my 2 year degree in Automotive Technology.
        My first job as an auto tech was at an Acura dealership in Lynwood, WA. As many of you might know, the Acura brand is just Hondas luxury brand. Thus, my excitement when a Honda Acty (Hondas Kei truck) pulled in for a messed up steering column.
        This compact, simple, and unique looking vehicle caught my eye. I walked up to it when I noticed the steering wheel was on the right side of the car instead. A very normal thing in Japan, but not here.
        I ended up talking to the owner about it for a while, and he explained in detail, all the plans he had for it. It was a little work truck he used around his farm a lot because of its hydraulic dump bed. (You mean the bed can lift up and dump things out??)
        He went on to tell me about how he had plans to convert it into a little camper for his son. Hearing about how simple of a vehicle this was, and how the only limits are the stretch of your imagination, I needed to learn more. I loved this truck.

      <h2>Things to Watch Out For</h2>
      <p>
     While Kei trucks are awesome little machines, there are a few things to keep in mind before diving in. 
     First off, legality varies from state to state here in the U.S (see state-by-state link on home page). Some states allow them on all roads, 
     others limit them to off-road or agricultural use, so always double-check your local DMV rules. 
     You’ll also hear about the “25-year rule,” which means imported vehicles must be at least 25 years old 
     to legally meet U.S. import standards without major modifications. That’s why most Kei trucks you’ll 
     find for sale are older models from the ’90s or early 2000s. Even though they’re small and look cheap, 
     the price often runs between $7,000 and $10,000 once you factor in shipping, customs fees, and import costs. 
     They’re still a great value for what you get. Unique character, amazing practicality, and tons of personality,
     but it’s good to know what you’re getting into before buying one.
