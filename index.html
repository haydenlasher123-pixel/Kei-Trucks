<p>Let me introduce you to... The Kei Truck!</p>

<div id="one">
<h3> One of the single greatest automotive inventions (in my humble opinion) still used around the world to this day. </h3>
</div>

<div id="two">
<h3> Created as a practical and affordable utility vehicle, in Japan's post-war economy for farmers and businesses, the Kei Truck became a cultural icon. Because of its simple design, large array of aftermarket customizations, and lower requirement for mechanical aptitude, it has led to tens of thousands of unique Kei trucks throughout the world and a huge rise in popularity.</h3>
