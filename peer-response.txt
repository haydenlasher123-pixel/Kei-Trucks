Peer Feedback (copied from my reviewer)

"Your content is amazing, it has interesting information and seems like something you are genuinely interested about. The layout is easy to understand and looks well.

1. I like the color scheme but would switch it, where yellow is an accent color over it taking over the whole background. My reasoning is it's the background for your content as well and is a very bright color. Maybe have the same green that is the text as the background and have the yellow as the text.

2. In your about site, I would do an off white to help with the brightness.

3. I think your site should of had more modded Kei trucks, they are very interesting!"


My Changes Based on Their Suggestions

I chose to tackle 2 and 3 of her concerns.

Suggestion #2: Change About page background  
- I updated the About page background to an off-white shade to lower brightness and make the text easier to read.

Suggestion #3: Add more modded Kei trucks  
- I added more modified Kei truck images to the Gallery page, including different builds and captions to make the gallery more interesting.


Self-Assessment (only one peer responded)

I only received one peer review, so I also reviewed my own site.  
I added an additional page (“Guide”) and included a Kei truck comparison table to improve clarity, content, and overall usefulness of the website.
