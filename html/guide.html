        or buy one locally, it helps to know how you plan to use it and what kind of setup
        fits your life.</p>
      <p>This page gives a quick overview of some popular Kei truck models and the types of
        builds they are usually used for.</p></section>

              <td>
                Most Actys are older now, so check for rust and plan on slower highway speeds

                Great for lowered “mini truck” style builds, tons of character, easy to park anywhere

              <td>
                Works well with toppers and roof racks, enclosed bed keeps tools out of the weather

              <td>
                Added topper and racks add weight, so expect slightly less fuel mileage and performance

        Of course there's many more makes and models. These are just very common ones. No matter which model you like, double check your state or local laws for on road use,
        and try to get a pre purchase inspection before you buy.
